# Classification-Web-App
This is a machine learning-based image classification service. It uses a neural network trained on a labeled dataset to classify images of cats and dogs. 

The model was trained and evaluated in a [Google Colab Service](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ixqm90cwy7TtyRHOZ---QQHyacoZNfg3#scrollTo=6ZuNFeOuHNlc&uniqifier=1).
The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing.
- Model training.
- Model evaluation achieving [90>=% accuracy].
